        "**Overview.**\n",
        "I evaluated three prompt styles to generate SQL from a fixed retail schema: (V1) Baseline, (V2) Strict schema-anchored, and (V3) Self-checking validator. I asked questions about revenue, margin, and rankings, plus an impossible question to test refusals. Revenue was defined as products.price * sales.quantity and cost as product_suppliers.supply_price * sales.quantity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Results.**\n",
        "\n",
        "V1 (Baseline): Often produced correct SQL for straightforward joins (sales→products/customers). However, it sometimes added prose (“Summary: …”) or used implicit joins. On the impossible question (emails), it occasionally attempted to guess a column instead of refusing, yielding hallucinated fields.\n",
        "\n",
        "V2 (Strict): Reliability improved markedly. Output was usually a single SQL statement with explicit JOINs and clear aliases. It correctly refused with exactly “I do not know” for unavailable attributes (e.g., emails). It followed the margin/revenue definitions consistently.\n",
        "\n",
        "V3 (Self-checking): Matched V2’s accuracy and further reduced schema mistakes. It almost never referenced non-existent columns and respected the “only SQL” constraint. For multi-step logic (e.g., margin by salesperson and timeframe), V3 used CTEs cleanly. The validator mindset helped avoid aggregation mismatches (GROUP BY vs SELECT).\n",
        "\n",
        "What didn’t work well / hallucinations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lax constraints (V1). Without explicit “ONLY SQL / no prose,” outputs sometimes included commentary or markdown fences.\n",
        "\n",
        "Missing attributes. When the question requested unschematized data (e.g., emails, discounts), V1 sometimes invented columns. V2/V3 fixed this with strict refusal language.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ambiguous business terms. If the question asked for “profit” rather than the defined “margin = revenue - cost,” V1 occasionally diverged (e.g., ignoring cost); V2/V3 were better once instructions defined margin precisely.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key prompt techniques that helped.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Schema anchoring & join map reduce table/column hallucinations.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Only SQL or ‘I do not know’” plus no-prose formatting keeps outputs usable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Explicit definitions (revenue, cost, margin) eliminate semantic drift.\n",
        "\n",
        "CTE encouragement creates clearer, safer queries for multi-step calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Self-validation (V3) cuts errors: “verify each column exists; check join keys; ensure GROUP BY matches.”\n",
        "\n",
        "**What I learned.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Strong guardrails (format, refusal rules) dramatically improve reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Giving the model precise business formulas prevents subtle mistakes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Self-checking language (even without showing the reasoning) reduces column/aggregation bugs.\n",
        "\n",
        "A small post-processing layer (remove backticks, pretty-print) helps productionize results.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is important to include an “impossible question” test; it reveals whether the prompt truly blocks hallucination.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bottom line.\n",
        "V2 and V3 are production-grade: they consistently produce clean SQL or clean refusals. V1 is useful for quick prototyping but risks formatting drift and hallucinated fields. For grading and real use, prefer V3, with V2 as a solid fallback."
